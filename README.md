# Activity Tracker

Activity Tracker is an application designed to track what programs you use throughout the day, how long. 
The information collected can then be visually presented to the user as a daily/weekly/monthly report or in raw format.
Written in Python.

## ToDo

- visualization
  - minimum: piechart (show breakdown of all apps), time series (with distribution of apps), piechart per app (if more details are available)
  - ideally: interactive interface...
- add more information to macos info extractor (details about app, title?)
- add requirements.txt (for macos pyobjc? so it doesn't need to run with macos' python)
- logger (compression? other features?)
- front end (web based? GUI?)
